# FS-004-check-audit: fissile check and audit enforce file budgets

`fissile check` and `fissile audit` are the user-visible enforcement surfaces
for the library core. `check` is the commit-time gate; `audit` is the whole-repo
inventory and migration tool. Both use the same effective config, rule
resolution, exclusions, messages, and exception registries.

## 1. Check

```text
fissile check [<paths>...] [--staged] [--config <path>] [--format text|json] [--no-color]
```

`check --staged` receives the file set from git and applies `[scan].exclude`.
Without `--staged`, `check` evaluates the paths passed by the caller or the
configured scan scope. A file strictly above a soft limit produces a finding
and exits `0` unless a matching soft exception applies; equality passes. A file
strictly above a hard limit produces a finding and exits non-zero unless a
matching hard exception applies; equality passes. Severity is not configurable.
This is the stable
CI/pre-commit contract: the same config must produce the same pass/fail result
locally and remotely (§GOAL-003-friendly-output).

Text findings are grouped, one block per `(severity, rule, rendered guidance)`.
The header names the severity, the file count, the crossed limit, the rule, and
the message ID; the guidance follows once, indented two spaces; the files follow
indented four. Guidance is never repeated per file — a repo-wide run says what
to do once and then lists what it applies to (§GOAL-003-friendly-output).

```text
hard: 2 files over the 550-line budget [rule: rust-source, message: split-rust-hard]
  Must split before more code lands here: move cohesive groups of items into
  sibling modules. If you cannot see a safe split, stop and ask a human.
    src/domain/order.rs: 612 non-blank lines (budget 550)
    src/domain/invoice.rs: 588 non-blank lines (budget 550)

soft: 1 file over the 350-line budget [rule: rust-source, message: split-rust-soft]
  Should split the next time you touch it. If no split leaves the architecture
  cleaner, record it with `fissile exception add --severity soft`.
    src/domain/tax.rs: 402 non-blank lines (budget 350)
```

Blocks are ordered hard before soft, then by rule ID; files within a block are
ordered by measured value descending, then by path. Blocks are separated by a
blank line. A message that interpolates a per-file variable renders distinct
text per file, which by the grouping key puts each file in its own block
(§FS-001-config.4).

For a line rule, each file detail is `<path>: <actual> <counting basis> (budget
<limit>)`. UTF-8 measurements name `physical lines` when blank and comment lines
count, `non-blank lines` when only blank lines are excluded, `non-comment lines`
when only comment lines are excluded, and `non-blank, non-comment lines` when
both are excluded. A non-UTF-8 raw-line measurement names `physical lines`.
Byte and token findings retain `<path>: <actual> <unit>`.

Each detail also names the ceiling a `fissile exception add` with no `--max`
would write for that file: the measurement quantized up to the unit's
`[exceptions.bump]` step (§DF-006-quantized-ceilings.1, §FS-005-exception-add.2).
It is the number that command already computes, said at the moment the caller is
choosing between the plain form and `--max`, so a line rule reads

```text
    src/domain/order.rs: 612 non-blank lines (budget 550; an exception here would accept 700)
```

and a byte or token rule, which carries no budget clause, opens a parenthesis of
its own:

```text
    assets/atlas.bin: 5200 bytes (an exception here would accept 8192)
```

The number is what makes the plain form the obvious one to reach for. A ceiling
stated with `--max` is written exactly as stated
(§DF-010-stated-ceilings-are-exact.1), so a caller who copies the measurement
off this line into `--max` records a ceiling with no headroom and fails the gate
on the next unrelated edit; the ceiling named beside it is the entry they would
get by asking for nothing. Where an entry already stands at the address, `add`
refuses and names `fissile exception retune` (§FS-005-exception-add.4), which
writes this same number — the line says what the file would be accepted at, not
which of the two commands writes it. It is not the `next <step>-<unit> step: N`
that `add` and `retune` print on a result (§FS-005-exception-add.2): that one is
a round number a *stated* ceiling passed up and never applied, and this one is
the ceiling that would actually be recorded.

The ceiling is named only where that plain call would be accepted. For a soft
finding on a rule that also sets a hard limit, a ceiling at or above that limit
is refused while the file is still under it, because the hard finding fires
there and the soft entry would never match (§DF-010-stated-ceilings-are-exact.2);
the detail then names no ceiling at all rather than a number the command would
decline. A file already past the hard limit keeps its number, on the same terms
that accept the entry — it is the record of the debt (§FS-005-exception-add.4).
A hard finding never withholds it: nothing binds a hard ceiling, and the
quantized value is at or above a measurement already over the limit.

One case deliberately says less than it could. `add` also accepts a soft ceiling
above the hard limit when the hard registry holds a *deferred* entry at the same
address (§FS-005-exception-add.4), and a finding does not read the registries to
find out — it withholds there too. Withholding is the direction that cannot
mislead. The caller runs the plain form and gets the entry the command would
have written anyway; a number printed here that ended in a refusal would have
sent them somewhere with nothing to do.

Guidance is wrapped at a fixed 78 columns, and newlines written into the message
are kept, so a project that configures a paragraph gets a readable block. The
width is fixed rather than read from the terminal: the same finding must be
byte-identical in a narrow terminal and in CI (§GOAL-006-graded-limits.2).

### 1.1 The hint line

A `check` run that reports at least one finding adds one `hint:` line naming
`fissile measure`, directly beneath the findings it is about:

```text
hint: fissile measure <path>... reports size and headroom for the files you split into.
```

The finding already carries the offending file's measurement and the limit it
crossed, so the hint is not about that file. It is about the ones the split
moves code *into*, whose headroom decides where the seam can go and which no
other tool computes (§FS-007-measure). One line, once per run, never per file,
and only when a *finding* was reported — a run whose only block is the stale
inventory of §1.3 has no split to place, and a clean run stays exactly `ok`.

This line and §1.2 are the two things `check` prints that are not findings. Both
exist because the instructions they carry left the managed agent block
(§DF-007-instructions-at-the-error-site.2), and both are bounded to a single
line so that §GOAL-004-token-thrift still holds for a run that reports many
files.

### 1.2 The commit-gate epilogue

A `check --staged` run that exits non-zero closes by saying so. Every reason to
fail has an epilogue, and the two are decided together: an epilogue printed
without failing is a false alarm, and a failure printed without one aborts the
commit with output that reads as advisory.

A standing hard overflow:

```text
commit blocked by fissile. Split the file, or ask a human for a reviewed hard
exception. Bypassing with --no-verify leaves the overflow for review or CI.
```

A dead exception entry under `[exceptions].stale = "error"` (§1.3), where there
is no file to split and the fix is in the registry the block above names:

```text
commit blocked by fissile. Remove the exception entry above, or point it at the
path its file moved to. Bypassing with --no-verify leaves a dead entry in the
registry.
```

A staged file that could not be measured, which exits 2 (§5) with nothing above
accounting for it:

```text
commit blocked by fissile. A staged file could not be measured, so nothing above
accounts for it — fix the path the error names, or unstage it. Bypassing with
--no-verify commits a file fissile never checked.
```

A run blocked by more than one leads with the overflow, then the dead entry: the
split is the largest thing to do, and each block is on screen above the epilogue
either way.

Only `--staged` prints an epilogue, because only `--staged` is a commit: the
same findings from a CI run or a manual `fissile check src/` are not blocking
anything a caller is about to bypass. It says the one thing the finding's own
guidance cannot, since a project rewrites that guidance (§DF-003-severity-guidance.1)
and it is the wrong voice regardless — `--no-verify` is reached for by a caller
who has just decided the gate is in the way.

### 1.3 Stale exceptions

`check` reports every `match = "exact"` exception entry its own file set proves
has outlived its file, in a block of its own:

```text
stale: 1 exception accepts a file that is not there [registry: docs/file-size-agent-exceptions.toml]
  The file moved or was deleted, so the entry silences nothing. Remove it with
  `fissile exception remove`, or point it at the path the file moved to.
    src/domain/order.rs [soft, rule: rust-source]
```

Entries are reported under `[exceptions].stale`: `warn` reports them, `error`
also fails the run — and through the pre-commit hook, blocks the commit (§1.2) —
`ignore` says nothing (§FS-003-exceptions.4).

`check` reports only what its file set proves, and its three file sets prove
different things:

- **`--staged`** is a commit, and a commit proves what it removes: the entry is
  reported when the run stages the deletion of its path or a rename away from
  it — the moment it died, with the diff that killed it on screen.
- **The configured scan scope** — plain `fissile check` — is the whole
  inventory, so an entry matching nothing in it is stale by §2's comparison,
  provided no file stands at its path: one the scope excludes or git ignores is
  right where the entry says, and §2 reports it without blocking a build.
- **Caller-passed paths** are a window, not an inventory, and prove nothing
  about an entry naming some other file. Nothing is reported.

Absence from the working tree is deliberately *not* the test on its own. A path can be
missing because a build has not written it, or because someone deleted it
without staging the deletion; neither means the entry has outlived anything, and
under `error` each would stand between the author and every later commit over an
entry that is still correct.

Globs are not judged here: a glob matching no file today is a question about the
scan scope, which is `audit`'s inventory to answer (§2), not a fact a commit
hook can establish.

So this is the staleness §2 reports, under the same setting and by the same
comparison — one fact, not two (§FS-003-exceptions.4). `check` only ever says
less: a narrower file set, and never a file that is still there.

JSON output emits one record per overflow with at least:

- `path`
- `unit`
- `actual`
- `limit`
- `severity`
- `rule_id`
- `message_id`
- `message`
- `exception_would_accept`, when the finding names a ceiling
- `exception_max`, when applicable in audit's silenced output

`exception_would_accept` carries the same number the text detail names and is
omitted wherever the text withholds it, so a consumer of `--format json` chooses
between the plain and the stated form on the same facts a reader of the text
does. It is absent from a silenced `audit` record, which carries `exception_max`
— the ceiling the entry that already accepts the file records — instead.

When no findings are emitted, text output prints exactly `ok`; JSON output emits
no success envelope.

A `check` run can exit non-zero for something that is not an overflow — a dead
exception entry under `[exceptions].stale = "error"` (§1.3). The findings array
is the stable machine contract and grows no second record shape for it: the
stale block goes to stderr, which already owns every diagnostic a JSON run emits
(§5). What is ruled out is the one shape a consumer cannot act on — an empty
array, a failing exit code, and nothing anywhere saying why.

## 2. Audit

```text
fissile audit [--config <path>] [--format text|json] [--top <N>]
              [--stale-exceptions] [--rule-coverage]
```

`audit` walks the configured scan scope and reports the current repository
state. It is for adoption and maintenance, not just pass/fail.

- Default audit reports current soft and hard overflows.
- Default audit also counts the exception registries by kind
  (§FS-003-exceptions.2.1), both as registry entries and as distinct literal
  `path` expressions across the soft and hard registries. The entry totals say
  how many entries are accepted permanently versus how many carry debt someone
  has to retire; the path totals say how many distinct path expressions carry
  each kind. A path expression is structural when any entry with the same
  `Exception::path` is structural, and deferred otherwise, regardless of
  registry or entry order. A glob is one literal path expression and is counted
  once; audit does not expand it into the files it currently matches:

  ```text
  exceptions:
    structural (never expires): 3 entries across 3 paths
    deferred (carrying debt): 32 entries across 20 paths
  ```

  The section is omitted from text output when both registries are empty, so a
  repository with no exceptions pays nothing for it. JSON always carries the
  object with numeric `structural` and `deferred` entry totals plus numeric
  `structural_paths` and `deferred_paths` distinct path totals, because a
  consumer should not have to distinguish "no exceptions" from "this build does
  not report them".
- `--top <N>` reports the largest measured files per unit, after exclusions, even
  when they are under limit. Where a rule measures the file in that unit, the
  value is the one that rule counts — its line policy decides what a line is
  (§FS-001-config.3.1) — so a `--top` number and a finding never disagree about
  one file. Every other scanned file still ranks, under the default line policy:
  `--top` is the adoption surface, and a repository whose rules do not yet reach
  its largest file is the repository that most needs to be told about it.
- `--stale-exceptions` reports every exception entry whose path or glob matches
  no scanned file, each named by its registry and its `path` (§FS-003-exceptions.4)
  — the list spans both registries, and the same path can be stale in each. It
  reports **loose** entries in the same pass: an exact-path entry whose ceiling
  stands more than one bump step above the file it accepts
  (§FS-003-exceptions.7), with the ceiling `fissile exception retune` would write
  in its place. Stale means the entry accepts a file that is gone; loose means it
  accepts far more of a file that is still there. An exact-path entry whose
  ceiling sits *exactly* on its file is reported in the same section, in the same
  line shape, with the advice prefixed `no headroom` (§FS-003-exceptions.7): it
  accepts precisely what the file measures, so it silences the finding today and
  stops on the next unrelated commit.

  The advice on a line is the first of these that applies, and each one is a call
  the named command performs — `audit` never names a remedy the command would
  decline:

  1. **The file no longer crosses the limit at all.** The entry silences
     nothing, so removing it is the remedy rather than moving it, and the line
     names `fissile exception remove` (§FS-009-exception-remove). There is no
     `no headroom` prefix here: an entry the file has fallen below is finished,
     not short of room.
  2. **A soft ceiling would land on the hard limit.** `retune` refuses the
     measured form there (§DF-010-stated-ceilings-are-exact.2), so the line names
     the stated one and the range that keeps the ceiling under the limit. The
     twin that exempts a ceiling here is resolved the same way `retune` resolves
     it. For an entry without headroom the range starts one unit above the
     measurement, since a ceiling at the measurement is what it already has; when
     that leaves the range empty — the file measures one under the hard limit —
     no soft ceiling grants headroom at all, and the line says so and names the
     hard registry instead.
  3. **The measurement is already a multiple of the step.** The measured form of
     `retune` would write the number already recorded and report that it changed
     nothing, so the line names the stated form with the step's next multiple
     filled in. This can only arise for an entry without headroom.
  4. **Otherwise** the line names a `retune to` value: for a loose entry the
     ceiling the step writes from the measurement, for one without headroom the
     step's next multiple strictly above it.

  ```text
  loose ceilings:
    docs/file-size-agent-exceptions.toml: src/domain/order.rs accepts 650 lines, now 421 — retune to 500
    docs/file-size-agent-exceptions.toml: src/domain/model.rs accepts 700 lines, now 472 — retune with --max <N> --unit lines, 472 <= N < 500
    docs/file-size-human-exceptions.toml: README.md accepts 519 lines, now 519 — no headroom; retune to 600
    docs/file-size-human-exceptions.toml: src/domain/tax.rs accepts 500 lines, now 500 — no headroom; retune with --max 600 --unit lines
    docs/file-size-agent-exceptions.toml: src/domain/vat.rs accepts 460 lines, now 460 — no headroom; retune with --max <N> --unit lines, 461 <= N < 500
    docs/file-size-agent-exceptions.toml: src/domain/fee.rs accepts 499 lines, now 499 — no headroom; no soft ceiling under the 500-line hard limit grants any — accept the file in the hard registry with `fissile exception add --severity hard`
  ```

  Every `loose` JSON record carries `no_headroom` as `0` or `1`, so a consumer
  reads which half of §FS-003-exceptions.7 it is looking at without parsing the
  line. The advice keeps the two fields the record already has: `retune_to` for
  case 4, and `stated_range` for cases 2 and 3 — `{"min": N, "max_excluded": M}`
  for a range, `{"min": N}` alone for a stated value with nothing above it to
  exclude. Exactly one of the two is set on every record, except where no
  ceiling under the hard limit grants headroom and there is none to name: then
  both are null. Case 2's empty range is that form — the file measures one unit
  under the hard limit — and so is a rule whose soft and hard limits coincide,
  which reaches it from the loose half, where the entry silences nothing and the
  line is the removal line of case 1.
- `--rule-coverage` reports which rules matched zero files, which files matched
  only built-in catch-all rules, and which rule/message pairs are unused.

`audit` exits non-zero for hard overflows and schema errors. Soft-only findings
exit `0`. Stale exceptions follow `[exceptions].stale`: `warn`, `error`, or
`ignore`.

## 3. Default Large-File Guard

The built-in config includes a simple byte-size guard over all non-excluded
files. It is intentionally boring: it catches accidental blobs and platform-host
problems before they reach review. Projects should tune or replace it with
named, project-specific rules once they know their layout.

This guard does not replace line or token budgets. A file may be checked by one
effective byte rule and one effective line rule at the same time (§FS-001-config.3.2).

## 4. Named Budget Entries

Findings always name the matched rule. The intended config style is a list of
named budget entries, similar to bundle-size tools but applied to source layout:

```toml
[[rules]]
id = "api-docs"
include = ["docs/api/**/*.md"]
unit = "lines"
soft = 500
hard = 900
message = "split-api-doc"
```

Names must be stable because exception entries, JSON consumers, and agent
guidance all key off them.

## 5. Errors

Failures split by scope. A **run-level** failure — an unreadable or invalid
config, an invalid exception registry, a failed `git diff --cached`, an
ambiguous rule overlap — aborts before findings and exits `2` with a single
`fissile <command>:` diagnostic on stderr. When the failing document is a file,
the diagnostic names it (`.agents/fissile.toml: config parse error: … at line
100`), and a failed git invocation appends git's own first stderr line so
"not a git repository" is visible verbatim.

A **file-level** failure — one path that cannot be read or measured (missing,
unreadable, a directory) — does not abort the run: one odd path must not hide
every other finding. The path is skipped, every other file is still measured,
findings print normally on stdout, and each skipped path adds one stderr line
that names it:

```text
fissile check: cannot measure src/gone.rs: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

A run with file-level failures exits `2` even when no finding stands — silently
passing an unmeasurable file would make the gate unsound — and the text success
marker is withheld. JSON output never carries error records: stdout keeps the
stable findings shape (§GOAL-003-friendly-output.1) and stderr owns diagnostics.

Non-UTF-8 content is not an error: line budgets measure physical lines from raw
bytes (§FS-001-config.3.1).
